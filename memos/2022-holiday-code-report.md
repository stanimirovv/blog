# 2022 Holiday code report

There's a bunch of things I did over the holidays in the moments I wasn't spending time with family and friend.

[First 10 days ](https://github.com/stanimirovv/code-trove/tree/main/advent-of-code-2022)of AoC - it is great stuff, but the moment I started lagging behind I found more interesting things to work on, at least short term.&#x20;

[Multi tenant micro k8](https://github.com/Sprinting-Software/multi-tenant-k8) helm example - simple and quick multi tenant app showing that helm, microk8 and NodeJS app are easy to setup and a simple setup doesn't have to take weeks

[Architecture validator](https://github.com/Sprinting-Software/architecture-validation-primer) - Validating your JS/TS dependencies can be automated as long as you have consistency in your project. Setup is fast, defining the rules is also easy as long as you know what you need

E-shop price tracker (closed source) think [pricebefore](https://www.pricebefore.com/redragon-k509-rgb-pc-gaming-keyboard-104-key-quiet-low-m79798.html) but for my country's two biggest shops. This one is a little rough arround the edges, or let's face it, really rough arround the edges since it was cobbled together in a day and a half, tests, CI infra included. I think it will get it's own post in a few weeks.
