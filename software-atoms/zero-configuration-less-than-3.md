# Zero configuration == <3



In the past I found highly configurable tools amazing.

Nowadays I tend to lean towards strongly oppinionated, zero configuration tools.

* Reduces oppinionated discussions since the descision is made by the tool
* Zero configuration means less code and easier integration with tools.

Semantics like tabs vs spaces, where to put the opening/closing bracket, mixedCase vs snake\_case are a matter of getting used to.

People will always gravitate towards what they are currently using and will use any reasoning to show how it is better.&#x20;



This is counter productive.

In 2-3 weeks your eyes will adapt to whatever styleguide you use.

Unfortunately if there are options you will be tempted to tweak them. It is natural since developers are curious by nature. This is why having no configuration options are good.

Good examples are golang's fmt - there is a single correct wayto format the code.

A JavaScript example is standard - zero configuration "Standard" style guide.
