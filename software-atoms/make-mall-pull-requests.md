# Make mall pull requests

Pull requests should be small and incremental.

\
Split your code delivery into the smallest possible chunks.

⭐ Less chance to introduce bugs.

⭐ Better reviews since people will review less code.

⭐ More ownership and mutual responsibility.\


There is no general rule on how to split your work. Practice it.
