# Good practices fade out

ğŸ˜” Sadly good practices tend to fade out.

If you have small commits you can easily locate errors.

ğŸ˜Š You won't have this pain for a while because you are doing the right thing.

You will forget you ever had it at all and your commits will become bigger.

Until they are so big you can't debug! ğŸ˜”

ğŸ’¡ That is why you should either automate the check or include the git commits as part of the code review.
