# Courses

\
I've taken \~10 or so courses in the past year with a wide variety of sources: courses from udemy, official courses for some technologies, free courses, etc.\
\
Bellow are some observations:\
\
🤓 Video is slower, but easier to digest. Also easier on your eyes after a day of work.\
\
💌  Popular courses are updated, but it can still take time. One of the most popular react courses in udemy got it's function components update months after it was the de facto standard for new projects.\
\
\
😔 Not-so-popular courses tend to lag in updates\
\
💡 Course length has little to do with course quality\
\
🫢 Courses aren't enough to become professional level at a topic, despite what some of them claim. They can be a nice intro, but you will still have a long way to go.\
\
🚩 Even though a lot of courses have "real life projects" they aren't "real life" by a long shot - a lot of the core complexity is removed. This is expected since nowadays real software is written by teams, not individuals, nevertheless courses can lead to overconfidence.\
\
🚀 People are looking for beginner or boothcamp style courses and that is where most effort is going. There is a lack of advanced courses.\
\
❤️ There are more and more awesome and free courses that you can see on youtube. One of my favorite examples is: [https://www.youtube.com/c/TechWorldwithNana](https://www.youtube.com/c/TechWorldwithNana)
