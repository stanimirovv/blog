# Most courses aren't worth it

They aren't built by hands on, people rather ex developers turned course makers.

Unfortunately, it shows.

I have taken \~20 courses the past year and a half and most of them weren't worth the time investment, which means that if I had invested the time in reading the docs instead of following the course it would have been more productive.

Which courses **are** worth it, you may ask ?\
1\. Official certification courses think amazon and azure for devops.

2\. Courses that are made by the technology of the framework or core contributors, like the [NestJS official courses](https://courses.nestjs.com/)

3\. People with proven industry expertise that are still hands on - think a course on how to get to a Staff Eng position by [Tanya Reilly](https://twitter.com/whereistanya) will be 50 times better than the same course made by a youtuber with 100k subs.

If you take anything else adjust your expectations. I am not saying they will be bad, they can be useful, but if you are past the "early senior" stage, chances are you are better off with the official docs.
