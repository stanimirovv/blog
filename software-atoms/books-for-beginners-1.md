# Books for beginners 1

When I was taking my first steps in software development the book that made the big difference wasn't the best written one, but the one with most excercises.\
\
It is common knowedge that to become good at programming you must practice, yet most beginner books do not include nearly enough excercises.\
\
Next time you recommend a book to someone starting out, make sure it has enough practice problems :)
