🫠 Growing as a developer is hard!\
\
⭐ After landing my first job in software development things were straightforward for a while.\
\
♻️ I encounter a problem, read, try, fail, improve, get mentored, try, fail, improve until I manage to do it.\
\
Although it was hard it felt secure - there was direction I knew I was on the road and I had to simply follow it.\
\
At some point I started doing my job well - the day to day tasks required less iterations, less mentoring.\
\
😟 It is when I stopped feeling secure. I didn't know how to progress.\
\
😲 There are infinite resources on how to start learning something.\
\
Surprisingly there are very few resources that help you get beyond the entry or junior level.\
\
❌ Most resources don't take into account that you need to keep in mind the specifics of your job\
❌ Or that you need to become good at searching information, learning\
❌ Or that, ultimately you must take charge, no article or book will show you what the path is for you\
\
I got together with [Zlatibor Veljković](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAA1s\_d0BbuOtaFIqj5ZS\_8As-abZH9izmQA) and we put together something special.A small booklet that will take the reader from a junior to mid level developer.\
\
The booklet:\
❤️ Respects the reader's time - no fluff\
❤️ Gives actionable steps that the reader can use to build their own path\
❤️ Covers the technical topics that you must invest time in so you can grow\
❤️ Gives an overview of secondary skills like filtering information, researching new topics and more\
&#x20;\
🪙 Normally, this is where you would see that the book is on sale for a fraction of the price and if you don't buy it now you will miss out.\
\
Trust me, you \*\*will\*\* miss out if you don't read it, but it won't cost you anything.\
\
We believe that information should be free.\
✔️ Free for consumption\
✔️ Free for improvement\
\
So we've made the book opensource.\
