# Book alternatives

🛑 You don't need books to learn new technologies!

When I was starting out in \~2011 books were a huge part of how new technologies were learned.

📚 They contained useful tips, down to earth explanations and many, many examples.

These books had their fair share of problems - old versions of the language/framework, outdated coding practices, etc.

Nowadays I am very happy that developers no longer need to rely on books.

📘 If you are a complete beginner, you can find hours long free tutorials on YouTube that can get you started with a technology. The community is thriving and you will always find something up to date.

📗 After the basics are done you can mostly rely on the official documentation. Look for beginner sections and example projects. Documentation has really improved over the last years.

❤️ By using the official docs you are not only removing issues with outdated versions and practices, but you are also learning to navigate docs faster which is an invaluable skill on its own.

As with anything technical - don't forget to practice, practice, practice - experiment with everything you read.

💡 Don't get me wrong - you should still read a lot of books. Books about principles like Clean Code and The Pragmatic Programmer. Books about architectures, different styles of programming. And ofcourse, the few in-depth technological books that really dive deep like Rust for Rustaceans.
