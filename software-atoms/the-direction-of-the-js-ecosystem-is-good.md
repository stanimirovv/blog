# The Direction of the JS ecosystem is good

he JavaScript ecosystem is slowly moving in the right direction.

The tooling is very, very complicated. Transpilers, linters, bundlers, different standards, competing testing libraries and runners.

Choosing between several assertion libraries doesn't improve your project's test coverage.

Frameworks like Nest and Next battle this by making the decisions and offering specific solutions "out of the box". This is a good start, but it solves the problem on the framework level.

The ecosystem itself is still complicated.

Bun tries to fix this on the platform level, which is one step further.

Perhaps bun is the future, on a conceptual level it is the better solution, but the deciding factor will be the adoption. Deno was promising but it hasn't gotten that much traction.

Another problem is that migrating to bun will require a lot of effort and you will be replacing battle tested software and ecosystem.

Although things are starting to look promising I don't think the complexity in the JavaScript ecosystem will be solved anytime soon.
