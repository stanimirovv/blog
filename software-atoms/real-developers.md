# Real Developers

🤖 There is a widely spread notion that "real" developers use only vim, emacs code only in the terminal and don't use debuggers.

💔 They are just a part of romanticized "Software Craftsman" persona many developers try to pickup.

Don't get me wrong - vim and emacs are amazing and perfectly fine to use, I used vim for the first 7 years of my career.

⭐ Don't forget those are just tools. If a tool constantly takes up of your time or isn't actively helping you get things done faster it is probably time to change it. Regardless that it is "not the craftsman way" or any other nonsense.

The timely delivery of mostly bug free features is what is measured, that is where the craftsmanship is, not in your editor or colorscheme.
