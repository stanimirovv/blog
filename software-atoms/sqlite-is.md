Why is SQLite a great choice ?

* It is just a library - you can have a single container deployment that includes your service and db. Less complexity, pipelines, monitoring and backups.
* It's performance is great, especially since it is in the same machine and your pet projects won't have hundreds of gigabytes of data.
* Testing is easier - seeding your database and creating new instances is trivial since sqlite is a single file per db. This can give you a lot of cheap, fast and reliable solutions.
