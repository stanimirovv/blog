# 10x Developer

🧐 Remember a few years ago when for \~18 months every day a new blog on the legendary, mythical 10x developer poped up on HN ?

Yeah, I don't miss it too.

💥 The irony of the entire movement is the implication that any single person can build anything as long as they are good enough technically.

We can't. We are beyond the one-developer-army point.

Don't believe me ? Look up the contributor count of your favorite open source project. There is always a team. 😉 There is always effort towards building a thriving community.
