# More functions == good

Adding just a few lines to an existing function?

Make a new one.

Call it from the current function.

It may seem wierd to extract "just a few lines" into a function, but you should.

It is the clean code way, which isn't that important.

Complexity adds up.&#x20;

Few lines today, god class tomorrow.

Fight symptoms early.&#x20;

And consistently.
