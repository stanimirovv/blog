# Interviews should copy Advent of Code

I think the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) tasks are pretty good for interview format - since there are 2 subtasks and the second one is a refactoring of the first one you get to see how the person refactors and adapts code.

Since the questions (so far) aren't that algorithmic it is less likely you will tilt the person.

I just might do some experimenting with it in the next interview cycle.
