# Universal Practices

⭐ Universal practices are propagated globally.

Take automated tests for example.

You can find them in the foundational open source projects like the Linux Kernel, gcc, NodeJS.

You can find them in frameworks like React, Express, Angular.

You can find them in the better programming books.

😉 And hopefully in your project.
